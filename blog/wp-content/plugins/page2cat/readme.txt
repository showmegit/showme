Use pages as category archive header, or list some posts from a category into a post/page. 

== Description ==

This plugin will let you setup connection between pages and categories, in order to display the page content like a "header" for your category archive (theme tweak required). By popular demand, version 2.5 also ships with a shortcode like [catlist] that allows to display a list of posts from a certain category inside a post or a page.
